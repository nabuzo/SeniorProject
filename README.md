# *The importance of Symmetric Cyrptography.*
* In this project, I am going to demonstrate the following symmetric encryption techniques: Caesar Cipher and the Avalanche Effect of AES. 
* The following techniques will illustrate the use of symmetric cryptography.

Why Cryptography is important for security?
* "Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message" (Understanding Cyrptography, 3). This technique allows people to have confidence in sending important information in the electronic world.
Cyrptography itself is split into three main branches: Symmetric Algorithms, Asymmetric Algorithms, and Protocol. In this project, I will be focusing on Symmetric Algorithms. 

What is Symmetric Algorithm? 
* Symmetric Algorithm is what many people assume cryptography is all about. Two parties have an encryption and decryption method for which they share a secret key. Some examples of symmetric encryption are: Blowfish, AES, RC4, DES, RC5, and RC6. This project will show the two encryption techniques which are: Caesar's Cipher (the simplest method of encryption) and Avalanche Effect of AES.
