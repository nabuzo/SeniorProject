# *The importance of Symmetric Cyrptography.*
* In this project, I am going to demonstrate the following symmetric encryption techniques: Caesar Cipher and the Avalanche Effect of AES. 
* The following techniques will illustrate the use of symmetric cryptography.

Why Cryptography is important for security?
* "Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message" (Understanding Cyrptography, 3). This technique allows people to have confidence in sending important information in the electronic world.
Cyrptography itself is split into three main branches: Symmetric Algorithms, Asymmetric Algorithms, and Protocol. In this project, I will be focusing on Symmetric Algorithms. 

What is Symmetric Algorithm? 
* Symmetric Algorithm is what many people assume cryptography is all about. Two parties have an encryption and decryption method for which they share a secret key. Some examples of symmetric encryption are: Blowfish, AES, RC4, DES, RC5, and RC6. This project will show two encryption techniques which are: Caesar's Cipher (the simplest method of encryption) and Avalanche Effect of AES.

Caesar Cipher
* This is the first well cipher, a substitution cipher, was used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC. Caesar shifted each letter in his military commands in order to make them appear meaningless. My program works on subsitution cipher that determine what the key is to decrypt the message.

Avalanche Effect of AES
* AES is the most widely used symmetric cipher today. It has a block cipher with 128-bit block size and supported three key lengths: 128, 192, and 56 bit. My program shows avalanche effect which is calculated by changing one bit in plaintext and keeping the key the same. It improves the level of security by changing one bit in encryption. Avalanche effect creates a combination of confusion and diffusion to enhance the security level.

How does Symmetric Algorthim improved and how it influenced our current crypto systems?
